<Info>This component is only used when constructing custom Nodes</Info>

## Description

The Anchor component has a few purposes.
First, it is used to track the point on the DOM associated with the anchor. We only update the position when the Node is resized as it is otherwise dependent on the parent.
This allows us to have hudnreds of anchors per node if necessary! Anchor is passed as a child of a Node component, and can be placed anywhere using CSS.
You can create your own custom Anchors by passing HTML elements or components as children. We also expose a few properties representing the state of the anchor that you can use to control the classes of your custom Anchor.

If you are using our data flow system, you can also pass the input and output stores associated with the Anchor and we will connect them for you.

Anchors can be created as inputs, outputs or neither, which controls the connection logic. (Inputs cannot be connectd to inputs.)

```html MyNode.svelte
<script>
  import { Node, Anchor } from 'svelvet';
</script>

<Node let:grabHandle let:selected>
  <div use:grabHandle class:selected>
    <div class="input-anchors">
      <Anchor input />
      <Anchor id="data-connection" input />
      <Anchor multiple input connections={[["node1", "4"],["node2", "3"]]}/>
    </div>
    <div class="output-anchors">
      <Anchor let:linked let:hovering let:connecting output edge="{CustomEdge}">
        <CustomAnchor {linked} {hovering} {connecting} />
      </Anchor>
      <Anchor direction="east" output />
    </div>
  </div>
</Node>
```

## Props

<ResponseField name="id" type="string | number" default="incrementing integer">
  Identification for the Anchor. If not passed, defaults to an incrementing
  integer starting at 1 for each Node. Used as the HTML id value for the element
  taking the form A-id/N-id
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="input" type="boolean" default="false">
  Boolean that specifies the anchor can only connect to output or no-preference
  anchors. When not passed, anchor allows all connections.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="output" type="boolean" default="false">
  Boolean that specifies the anchor can only connect to inputs or no-preference
  anchors. When not passed, anchor allows all connections.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="multiple" type="boolean" default="input/output dependent">
  Boolean used to control whether input anchors can have multiple connections.
  This is false for input anchors and true for output and no-preference anchors.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField
  name="direction"
  type="north | south | east | west"
  default="graph direction dependent"
>
  Enum used to control the "directionality" of the anchor. By default, an input
  anchor on the left side of the node has a directionality of "west". This is
  used to control the curvature of the edge.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="edge" type="Svelte Component | null" default="null">
  An Edge component meant to be associate with the Anchor. Every connection made
  from this anchor, will render out the corresponding Edge.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="connections" type="Array<[nodeId, anchorId]>" default="[]">
  Array of anchors to connect to. Edges can be created dynamically, but this
  used to specify Edges ahead of time.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField
  name="inputsStore"
  type="ReturnType<typeof generateInputs> | null"
  default="null"
>
  When using our data flow system, this is the store of possible inputs for the
  Node and is the return value of the function generateInputs.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="key" type="string | null" default="null">
  Key associated with the input
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField
  name="outputStore"
  type="Readable<unknown> | null"
  default=" null"
>
  When using our data flow system, this is the store associated with a data
  output of a node. It is return value of the function generateOutput.
</ResponseField>
