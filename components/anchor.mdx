<Info>This component is only used when constructing custom Nodes</Info>

## Description

Anchors are passed as children to a Node component, and can be placed anywhere using your preferred styling language.

You can customize the visual representation of the Anchor by passing HTML elements or Svelte components as children of the Anchor component.

We also expose a few properties representing the state of the Anchor that you can use to control the classes of your custom Anchor.

If you are using our data flow system, you can also pass the input and output stores associated with the Anchor and we will connect them for you.

Anchors can be created as inputs, outputs or neither, which controls the connection logic. (Inputs cannot be connectd to inputs.)

```HTML MyNode.svelte
<script>
  import { Node, Anchor } from 'svelvet';

  const connections = [["node1", "4"],["node2", "3"]]
</script>

<Node let:grabHandle let:selected>
  <div use:grabHandle class:selected>
    <div class="input-anchors">
      <Anchor input />
      <Anchor id="data-connection" input />
      <Anchor {connections} multiple input />
    </div>
    <div class="output-anchors">
      <Anchor let:linked let:hovering let:connecting output edge="{CustomEdge}">
        <CustomAnchor {linked} {hovering} {connecting} />
      </Anchor>
      <Anchor direction="east" output />
    </div>
  </div>
</Node>
```

## Props

<ResponseField name="id" type="string | number" default="incrementing integer">
  Identification for the Anchor. If not passed, defaults to an incrementing
  integer starting at 1 for each Node. Used as the HTML id value for the element
  taking the form A-id/N-id
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="input" type="boolean" default="false">
  Boolean that specifies the anchor can only connect to output or no-preference
  anchors. When not passed, anchor allows all connections.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="output" type="boolean" default="false">
  Boolean that specifies the anchor can only connect to inputs or no-preference
  anchors. When not passed, anchor allows all connections.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="multiple" type="boolean" default="input/output dependent">
  Boolean used to control whether input anchors can have multiple connections.
  This is false for input anchors and true for output and no-preference anchors.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField
  name="direction"
  type="north | south | east | west"
  default="graph direction dependent"
>
  Enum used to control the "directionality" of the anchor. By default, an input
  anchor on the left side of the node has a directionality of "west". This is
  used to control the curvature of the edge.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="edge" type="Svelte Component | null" default="null">
  An Edge component meant to be associated with the Anchor. Every connection
  made from this Anchor, will render out the corresponding Edge.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connections" type="Array<[nodeId, anchorId]>" default="[]">
  Array of anchors to connect to. Edges can be created dynamically, but this
  used to specify Edges ahead of time.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField
  name="inputsStore"
  type="ReturnType<typeof generateInputs> | null"
  default="null"
>
  When using our data flow system, this is the store of possible inputs for the
  Node and is the return value of the function generateInputs.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="key" type="string | null" default="null">
  Key associated with the input
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField
  name="outputStore"
  type="Readable<unknown> | null"
  default=" null"
>
  When using our data flow system, this is the store associated with a data
  output of a node. It is return value of the function generateOutput.
</ResponseField>

## Properties

<ResponseField name="let:linked" type="boolean">
  True when the Anchor has an active connection.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="let:connecting" type="boolean">
  True when the Anchor is rendering a temporary Edge connected to the cursor.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="let:hovering" type="boolean">
  True when the cursor is over the Anchor element
</ResponseField>
