**Svelvet `7.0.0`**

- Changed primary API. Users now pass Node components directly as children to Svelvet
- Exposed Anchor component that developers can add anywhere within their own custom nodes. Use it to wrap your own custom anchor elements or customize the default via props
- Added the ability to specify anchors as inputs, outputs or any. This controls connection logic and "directionality" of edge curvature
- Edges can be specified at the anchor level by passing in an array of connections: [[nodeId, anchorId]].
- Added the ability to dynamically attach/reattach edges
- Exposed Edge component for developer customization. Passed to anchor as prop.
- Exposed Node component for developer customization
- Exposed Resizer component that can be added to custom nodes
- Improved consistency of touch events on mobile devices. Added touch support for controls component.
- Nodes and Edges no longer require specified IDs. Defaults to incrementing value
- Added Controls component with zoom, reset, lock and unhide functionality plus the ability to pass custom control buttons as children
- Added keyboard navigation to graph when focused
- Added selection box functionality via Shift + Click. Color can be controlled via the selectionColor prop on the Svelvet component.
- Added node grouping functionality via Shift + CMD + Click
- No longer required to pass width/height to Svelvet component. Will fill wrapping component by default
- Added the ability to specify an arbitrary number of anchors on default nodes
- Added the ability to specify graph/node direction as top-down TD or left-right LR. Controls placement of input/output anchors on default nodes
- All new Minimap component that accepts props for placement, dimensions and styling the background and nodes (defaults to node color) and features dramatically improved tracking/visualization plus the ability to hide nodes
- Two way data binding for some parameters when creating default nodes via an array of Nodes a la Svelvet 6
- Added stacking logic when interacting with nodes

- Library now features 100% TypeScript coverage and 0 any's
- Removed D3-zoom dependency
- Removed redundant window and event listeners
- Added dynamic data flow/state management system that tracks anchor connections
