## Planned Features

What we're working on and thinking about.

### Persistent Graph state

We will be exposing functions that can be used to capture and restore the state of the graph. We may also expose a boolean that can be set on the Svelvet component to automatically save graph state to local storage.

### Customizable Background Component

Like the Minimap and Controls components, we plan on exposing the Background components for customization of grid size, dot color, background color, etc.

### Additional Data Input Components

We plan on creating additional input/parameter components that integrate with our data flow system and can be used when composing custom Nodes.

### Drag and Drop Drawer for Custom Components

Component that can take custom Nodes as props and add them to graph via the UI.

### Additional Customization of Input Mechanism

We'd like to add greater customization of how users interact with the graph, allowing fore defaults to be set on panning, zooming and selection functionality.

### Accesibility

It's high a priority for that navigating the graph is accessible for keyboard users. We plan on implementing Node movement and dynamic Edge creation soon.
