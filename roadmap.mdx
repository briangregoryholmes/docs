## Planned Features

What we're working on and thinking about.

### Persistent Canvas state

We will be exposing functions that can be used to capture and restore the state of the canvas. We may also expose a boolean that can be set on the Svelvet component to automatically save canvas state to local storage.

### Customizable Background Component

Like the Minimap and Controls components, we plan on exposing the Background components for customization of grid size, dot color, background color, etc.

### Improving Window Resize Logic

While the Svelvet component can now fill the size of its wrapping container, we want to improve the logic about node postioning and canvas scale on window resize.

### Additional Data Input Components

We plan on creating additional input/parameter components that integrate with our data flow system and can be used when composing custom Nodes.

### Drag and Drop Drawer for Custom Components

Component that can take custom Nodes as props and add them to canvas via the UI.

### Snap To Gride Guide Lines

Visual representation of Snap To Grid functionality a la Photoshop

### Additional Customization of Input Mechanism

We'd like to add greater customization of how users interact with the canvas, allowing fore defaults to be set on panning, zooming and selection functionality.

### Accesibility

It's high a priority for the Svelvet team that navigating the canvas is accessible for keyboard users. We plan on implementing Node movement and dynamic Edge creation soon.

### Conditional Custom Edges

Rendering out different custom edges based on the state of the associated Anchors.
