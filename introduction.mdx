## Description

Svelvet is a lightweight, powerful and infinitely customizable component library used to build interactive, node-based user interfaces.

Graphs are composed structurally by passing Groups, Nodes and other components as children to the Svelvet component. You can use standard Svelte syntax for conditional rendering and iteration to construct the graphs.

You have the option to configure our default node by passing props to the Node component, but you'll find that wrapping your own custom components in our Node component allows for greater flexibility and functionality.

Edges can be specified ahead of time or dynamically.
